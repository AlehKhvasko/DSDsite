## This is an Open Source Project for the Dallas Software Developer meetup group and community!
Our goal is to keep this beginner friendly. This way beginners can read the code, contribute, work together to keep the website up, and understand how to work on a larger project together.

*We will be using this Figma file for the design*
https://www.figma.com/file/8cpiqfhzCrzjqK7UOyJKvn/DSD?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Eno7CAj9zbn8ArtS-1

To start, there are a few considerations.

> - Download the repo
> - Once downloaded, use npm install
> - The run the development server using npm run dev

This project will be using **Next.js, React.js, Typescript, Appwrite, and Vanilla CSS.**
For testing, we will be using **React Testing Library and Jest**
https://testing-library.com/docs/
https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
*Especially with beginners working on this*, ***Typescript*** will be a great addition so we do not end up breaking things that shouldn't be broken and catch errors earlier on in the development process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
